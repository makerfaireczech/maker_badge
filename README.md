# Maker badge
The Maker badge board is official badge board for Maker FaireÂ´s in Czech republic. Main purpose is to show visitors/exhibitors name and/or project, but secondary goal is to have at each Maker Faire some interactive game so people can have more fun at the time of the visit.

This board supports Arduino and CircuitPython platform. 

CircuitPython will be **primary** platform for this board because it is very easy to use, and anybody who will buy board at some Maker Fair should be able very easily change (at least) her/his name on the display so anybody can know name of the person, when they start chating about something.  

I will try to add as many examples for both platforms, as I could, but I already saw few very interesting projects.

## How to use this board in 5 steps:  

1) Connect USB-C cable to the board and turn it on. 
Either use slide swith (top = OFF, down = ON) or move jumper to the middle pins. This depend on version which you have. 

2) Locate drive name "**Circuitpy**" and open **code.py** in some text editor. 
We recommend to use **Mu editor**, but even Notepad will work. 

3) Find line where is **"Jmeno"** (Name), **"Prijmeni"** (Surname), **"Firma/Projekt"** (Company/Project) and change it to whatever suit your need. 
There is yet no "auto aligning", so you have to also change X & Y coordinates for particular text. 

4) Save it via **CTRL+S/CMD+S** or you application menu for that. If screen does not refresh, push the RESET button. 

5) Unplug USB cable, put strap around your neck and wear it with proud.

## Board version

There are currently 3 revisions of the board:

- rev. A : this version was distributed by me and it was using **212 x 104 px** e-ink display with UC8151D driver
- rev. B : this board was assembled by me for Maker Faire Prague 2022 and it was using **250 x 122 px** e-ink display with SSD1680 driver from Make More. It contain same type of components as rev. A .  
- rev. C (with rev. B markings at the back): this board was assembled by PCBWay and it was using **250 x 122 px** e-ink display with SSD1680 driver from Make More. Some of the components are different because original parts was not available due to chip shortage. These boards were distributed between Maker Faire Brno 2022 (22 - 23/10/2022) and Maker Faire Prague 2023 (10 - 11/6/2023).
- rev.D : this board was assembled by PCBWay and it contain these changes:
	- slide switch for power control instead of jumper over pins
	- tranzistor at e-ink display power line to save power 
	- tranzistor at resistor devider for battery measuring
	- CR2032 holder was removed to save cost of the board

	These boards were distributed at Maker Faire Prague 2023 (10 - 11/6/2023) and onwards.
